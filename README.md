## What You‚Äôll Find in This Repo

Inside the `src` directory, you'll find three Clojure files:

- **petshop.clj** ‚Äì The main file used in the workshop. It walks through basic Datomic operations such as creating a database, performing transactions, and running queries.
- **music_brainz.clj** ‚Äì Contains more complex query examples. To run it, you'll need to restore the MusicBrainz sample database. See how to do this in the [Database Sample](#database-sample) section.
- **partitions.clj** ‚Äì Demonstrates how to use [implicit partitions](https://docs.datomic.com/transactions/partitions.html#implicit-partitions) in Datomic and discusses the performance implications.

## Getting Started

### Install Clojure

Follow the official instructions to install Clojure for your operating system:

https://clojure.org/guides/install_clojure

You'll also need to have Java installed.

---

### Download Datomic Pro

Download Datomic Pro from:

https://docs.datomic.com/setup/pro-setup.html#get-datomic

---

### Run a Transactor

For this workshop, you‚Äôll run a **dev mode** transactor locally.

Dev mode uses local disk storage and requires a transactor process to be running:

https://docs.datomic.com/setup/pro-setup.html#starting-a-transactor

---

### Running a REPL

You can use your preferred IDE or run the Datomic REPL directly.

If you don‚Äôt have a development environment set up, Datomic provides a REPL distribution.

With the transactor running, open another terminal tab, navigate to the `config` directory of your Datomic Pro distribution, and run:

```bash
bin/repl
```

---

### Running in Editors

You can also run the examples in your favorite editor:

[VSCode + Calva](https://calva.io/getting-started/)

[IntelliJ + Cursive](https://cursive-ide.com/userguide/index.html)

[Emacs + CIDER](https://docs.cider.mx/cider/basics/installation.html)

---

### Connecting to a Database

Here you can learn how to connect to a database:

https://docs.datomic.com/peer-tutorial/connect-to-a-database.html

Connection instructions are also included in the workshop source code.

---

### Database Sample

To use a sample database, follow the tutorial below using only the *Getting the Data* section of the mbrainz-sample repository.

[mbrainz-sample](https://github.com/Datomic/mbrainz-sample)
* Run the commands in a separate terminal tab too.
